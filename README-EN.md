# DeliGranREST
C Framework for REST applications

I build this application thinking that **in simplicity is greatness**, for which I base and use the following:

- [GNU Libmicrohttpd](https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/)
- [The GnuTLS Transport Layer Security Library](https://www.gnutls.org/)
- [SDS - Simple Dynamic Strings](https://github.com/antirez/sds)
- [libfyaml](https://github.com/pantoniou/libfyaml)
- [hashdict.c](https://github.com/exebook/hashdict.c)

Each implementation is always about making it as simple and straightforward as possible within a pure ecosystem in **C Language**, this in order to make it an easy product to implement but without losing the solidity and robustness that the **Language** provides **C**

In this repository I will be publishing the binaries so that people interested in what is described above can carry out their tests.
